	<h2>Nokia Developer Summit &#8211; Qt Ubiquity</h2>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
	When Nokia acquired the Norwegian-based Trolltech just over a year ago, some 
	had already seen the future. Now it's official: Qt is the new development 
	platform for Nokia devices. You read it right: Qt is a development platform 
	and not only a UI framework as many have wrongly come to think. Tools like 
	the QtCreator, QtDesigner and QtLinguist will be the new standard for Nokia 
	development. For those still unaware of this Qt-wave, Qt is basically a way 
	of doing common things in an easier and cross-platform way. Nokia made sure 
	to communicate this over and over again.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
	Qt will continue to enjoy its strong position in cross-platform development 
	for desktops but its adoption on Maemo, S60 and S40 devices will grow 
	steadily. Except for S40, all other devices already enjoy quite stable Qt 
	support. For our S40 friends, Qt may take a bit longer to appear since there 
	are some very challenging memory consumption problems that make it difficult 
	to port to such low-end phones.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
	Among many roadmap items revealed for Qt, there are extended support for 
	embedded devices (not limited to mobile phones in any extent), multi-touch 
	support, a new animation framework and expansion of its open-source model 
	allowing contributors to submit patches. Declarative UI is also a great 
	feature that is planned for the future and under very active research and 
	development. If well-designed, this will be a potential break-through.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
	Nokia's next big thing for Qt though, is its Qt-like service API layer. This 
	will allow cross-platform access to mobile devices services for S40, S60 and 
	Maemo. Nokia is also actively trying to collaborate with other device 
	manufacturers in order to have a standardized Qt API that would work across 
	multiple vendors.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
	Qt's development approach prioritizes a hybrid programming model where 
	multiple technologies can be mashed up together to achieve desired results. 
	This means that Qt can be used for combining the new Webkit technology, C++ 
	or even ECMAScript. Nokia's highlight here was for an easy-to-develop, 
	cheaper environment when compared to current Symbian development.</span></p>
