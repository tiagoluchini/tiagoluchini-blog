<h2>Nokia Developer Summit &#8211; Webkit: Nokia's future is web</h2>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
	Another shining star right beside Qt was Nokia's Webkit. The possibilities 
	around Webkit are overwhelming and Nokia couldn't praise this new technology 
	enough during the Summit: there were endless series of talks, keynotes, labs 
	and even hacking competitions around it.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
	By making use of the integrated Webkit, developers can implement 
	applications by simply writing HTML, CSS and JavaScript code. Any web-shop, 
	web developer or 12-year-old child is now able to develop highly visual and 
	appealing mobile applications by simply using the very same tools, languages 
	and techniques they would use for a traditional website. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
	Nokia exposes many mobile device service APIs to the Webkit allowing 
	developers to easily integrate SMS, Contacts, Calendar and etc into their 
	Webkit apps. This is not only planned to be extended on the roadmap but is 
	also already accessible via small bridge applications that can be designed 
	in Symbian for instance.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
	New devices like the N97 already support Webkit widgets natively in the home 
	screen. This is expected to be a pretty common future trend and is planned 
	to be supported in all future devices by default.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
	The official toolset for developing for the Webkit is the Aptana IDE but 
	other traditional Web-development tools are not only possible but sometimes 
	also recommended like Adobe's Photoshop, Adobe's Dreamweaver, Firebug and 
	other traditional AJAX tools. Nokia also provides a series of ready-made 
	widgets to be used in webkit apps but these can be easily replaced by any 
	Widgets library or even be re-implemented to target specific needs.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
	Nokia highlighted multiple times that the Webkit will free applications to 
	be as creative as possible and developers to be immensely productive. Talks 
	about increasing productivity and reducing time-to-market were a constant 
	during the whole event and Webkit was one of the main fuels behind it. The 
	ubiquity of web-developers also means cost-reduction and fierce competition 
	in the Webkit ecosystem.</span></p>
