<h2>Nokia Developer Summit &#8211; Devices and others feelings</h2>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
	Not surprisingly, Nokia did not focus the Summit too much on future devices. 
	It was clear that the main message conveyed was about development platforms 
	than hardware. However, the release of N97 was quickly highlighted. The main 
	feature made available on this new device is the support of the new home 
	screen platform and its Webkit widgets that can remain connect to the 
	internet as well as rearranged by the user.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
	Some other interesting numbers regarding devices were made public. The first 
	one was the number of Nokia devices in the market currently with embedded 
	cameras: 500.000.000. This is more than any single camera-specific 
	manufacturer. The second interesting number was the number of Nokia devices 
	currently supporting Flash on the market: 300.000.000 phones. Good news for 
	camera and Flash apps.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
	Microsoft's MySpace also presented their mobile strategy and mentioned that 
	engagement from mobile users has proved to be higher than normal web users. 
	Currently around 40% of all MySpace traffic comes from mobile clients. This 
	is also expected to drastically grow during the next 5 years.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
	Creative UI design has also been highly praised as powerful means to achieve 
	higher user engagement in mobile environments.&nbsp; Apparently Nokia is finally 
	aware that new UI concepts can be a good thing.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
	Location-based services are being called by Nokia as Social Location 
	services as Nokia thrives to add the social context to the location context. 
	As such, Nokia didn't spare hours of philosophical discussions about the 
	subject.</span><span lang="FI"><br>
