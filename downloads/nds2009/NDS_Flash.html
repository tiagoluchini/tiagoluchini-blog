<h2>Nokia Developer Summit &#8211; Flash increasingly more serious</h2>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
	Many have overseen Flash as a serious option for mobile apps due to its 
	strong history to graphical and animation. Some have come to consider it 
	simply a play-thing. Nokia is moving Flash to the &quot;really-serious&quot; category 
	though. And they are not alone. Adobe is amazingly active into making Flash 
	happen in the mobile platform: multi-touch support is being implemented, 
	license costs have been removed, internal specs have been made public and, 
	in simple worlds, Adobe is not afraid to &quot;evangelize&quot; businesses into using 
	Flash for real in mobile devices.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
	Even though the latest Flash Lite 3.1 is supporting only ActionScript 2 and 
	Flash 8-like applications the real break-through is behind the curtains: 
	Flash Lite 3.1 is already a distributable and updatable component very much 
	like its big brother today running on almost every single desktop computer 
	on the planet. And, as we are at it, 300 million mobile devices currently 
	carry Flash capabilities by default. The new generation of mobile flash 
	players will not only be distributable but also support ActionScript 3 and 
	Flash 10-like applications. This is expected to hit the market later this 
	year.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
	Adobe and Nokia are also very much into porting Adobe's AIR technology into 
	mobile devices. This can come as soon as next year and we got some inside 
	info that this is at advanced development stages in Nokia. This will put 
	Flash in a very comfortable and powerful position for mobile development.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
	This whole Flash horizon means great opportunities for ActionScript 
	developers and those keen on Flash, Flex, AIR and related technologies.</span></p>
