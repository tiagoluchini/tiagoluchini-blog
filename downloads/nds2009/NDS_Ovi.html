<h2>Nokia Developer Summit &#8211; The Ovi Platform, shifting onto services</h2>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
	If you haven't checked Ovi yet, you definitely should. Nokia's targets with 
	Ovi are big and, one might say, quite megalomaniac. The master plan is to 
	make Ovi a purely open service platform for a multitude of services 
	including also services provided by partners.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
	The first gem of the Ovi package is Ovi-store. Ovi-store will be released 
	still this year (late fall) first for a set of countries but soon to be 
	rolled out globally. Ovi-store can be seen as the combination of Nokia's old 
	Mosh community experience, the Download! application already sharing a large 
	penetration base, Forum Nokia and Nokia's Widset service. Combined, these 
	should provide enough background for Nokia to make Ovi-store really work.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
	Through Ovi-store, consumers will be able to discover, download, try and 
	purchase apps or other contents for their mobile devices. The whole 
	experience is supposed to be location-aware and to support viral behavior in 
	a very community-driven, tribal way.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
	Developers will have the ability to self publish applications through 
	publish.ovi.com and also sponsor their apps by hiring the so-called &quot;spotlight&quot; 
	feature that will put their apps under special positioning during the 
	end-user discovery process for a limited amount of time and to a specific 
	public.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
	The money flow is also expected to be a great plus for the whole 
	infra-structured being laid-down. Multiple payment modes will be supported 
	by Ovi-store and this also includes a unique integrated approach with mobile 
	operator billing systems. End-users will buy, pay through their operators 
	globally and application providers will receive up to 70% of the revenue.
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
	Even if not mentioned, it is clear that Nokia is trying to counter-attack 
	Apple's app store currently supported on the iPhone.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
	But Ovi is not limited at all to Ovi-store. Nokia's desire is to make it a 
	pure service platform through which apps developers can integrate social and 
	location-based services that will engage end-users in the mobile experience. 
	A very palpable first example is the plan for Nokia maps. Nokia maps are now 
	located under Ovi (maps.ovi.com) and will expose a series of APIs later this 
	year for application development. Nokia aims to create a healthy development 
	ecosystem were social location services will flourish on top of maps on ovi. 
	Other Ovi services will follow the same way paved by maps later and lead the 
	Ovi concept into this service-centric mind.</span></p>
