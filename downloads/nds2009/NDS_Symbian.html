<h2>Nokia Developer Summit &#8211; Symbian Foundation and the future of S60</h2>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
	It's sad to say but Symbian Foundation provided the dullest presentations 
	during the Summit as a whole. Most of the talk was around its pure 
	open-source philosophy and the creation of an active community effort to 
	provide a healthy development ecosystem. It remains to be seen whether this 
	will work and, most importantly, when this will happen. By now, only 4% of 
	the source code is under EPL (Eclipse Public License). The plan is to 
	achieve 100% by June 2010 but even the Foundation proponents seemed to doubt 
	that.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
	One of the main impediments to full open-source has been the legal front. 
	Things like the Java Virtual Machine are not in the platform even though 
	they are traditionally provided by device manufacturers. In this Java case, 
	Sun charges for manufacturers using their implementation and, as such, 
	exposing that as open-source is not legally possible. Symbian Foundation is 
	strongly considering replacing Sun's implementation with some other 
	open-sourced one if the legal battles prolong too much. Not very bright news 
	for our J2ME fellows and, it's important to mention, this was the only 
	mention to J2ME during the event.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
	There will be two licensing models in place for Symbian: EPL (Eclipse Public 
	License) for the community and SFL (Symbian Foundation License) for Symbian 
	partners only. This dual license model is expected to allow a very 
	business-friendly ecosystem.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
	It has been decided that the S60 naming convention will be dropped and the 
	next release will be simply called Symbiam^2. Future releases will follow 
	this numbering progressively. Symbian^3 has on its roadmap improved UI and 
	better Internet connectivity. Symbian^4 will be the first release to be 
	fully ran by the community-driven effort and, as such, the roadmap is still 
	open for community developers to create. It's a big recommendation though 
	that Qt will be an integral part of Symbian^4.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
	Maybe one of the biggest revelations was that the development tools for 
	traditional S60 programming are also being made open source. This will 
	include tools such as Carbide but also many others currently just used 
	internally by OEMS and Nokia.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
	Another important heads up is that the new Symbian will have a revamped 
	build system that will be better connected to Linux's standard make tools. 
	This might mean some learning needed for our Symbian friends.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
	Symbian Foundation is also working with Texas Instrument to be able to 
	provide an open hardware implementation. The latest device is called TI Zoom 
	2 and is already available.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
	The whole Symbian Foundation and its open-source movement is targeted to 
	make Symbian coders' lives easier by providing means of community-driven 
	peer review of platform code, bug fixing and submission of patches. 
	Submitting extensions to the platform code is also a possibility in the 
	future.</span></p>
