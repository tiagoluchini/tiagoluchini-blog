Virginia-based, business services management company <a href="http://www.managedobjects.com/" target="_blank">Managed Objects</a> has conducted a <a href="http://ztrek.blogspot.com/2007/06/blame-software-for-it-failures.html" target="_blank">survey in the US</a> that has been heatedly discussed on the blogsphere. A very disturbing conclusion of the survey is summarized as:
<blockquote><em>"IT managers are more likely to blame software for IT failures if their organization relies heavily on home-grown applications."Â </em></blockquote>
Although I make my living out of home-grown software, I have to agree that most home-based developers tend to recklessly forget the importance of stability on their applications. This would certainly explain this sad outcome from the survey.

There are three main reasons for in-home developers to end up with this extra burden:
<ul>
	<li><strong>lack of full-cycle methodologies:</strong> it is with an alarming frequency that I meet environments still not applying unit-testing for instance. The lack of certain steps in the development cycle or simply a very poor level of communication between stakeholders and developers may create all kind of stability problems in the future (or its perception anyway).</li>
	<li><strong>limited resources: </strong>very few companies invest what is needed for their home-grown applications. Normally the budgets are limited and professionals hired tend to be juniors and/or cheap enough to fit in those tight budget.</li>
	<li><strong>state of comfort: </strong>this is probably the most important reason - people just get comfortable after some period of time and start to neglect central aspects concerning the application being developed.</li>
</ul>
When we have people like Pascal Brosset, Senior Vice President of Market Strategy for SAP publicly encouraging IT managers with sentences like <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/projectfailures/?p=105" target="_blank">"Custom code over my dead body"</a>, it makes me wonder that independent developers and small consultancy companies may finally be loosing the war against giant off-the-shelf products.
