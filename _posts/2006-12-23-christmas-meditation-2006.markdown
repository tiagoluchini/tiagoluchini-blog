During this time of the year, people tend to read some specific passages of the Bible concerning Christ’s birth. There is one in particular which I appreciate a lot. It is in the book of Prophet Isaiah, chapter 9, verses 2 to 6. Let’s read it:
<blockquote>2 The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.
3 Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy: they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.
4  For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian.
5  For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire.
6  For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.</blockquote>
One of the most impressive things about this passage is that it was written around 770 before Christ. And it is fantastic the way that the Prophet Isaiah simply writes about Christ as it had already been born. That may by why some people call Isaiah “The Evangelist” instead of “the Prophet”.

God inspired Isaiah to write about something really important. This passage contains a very rich teaching for us.

Let’s read again the verse 2 (read the first part of it). The prophet is talking about all those people that walked in darkness. That includes all of us without any exception. That includes all of us who have sinned. And we all have. It includes all those who are in a state of darkness, under the power of sin and in ignorance of their sinful condition.

I’ve been there but I am happy to say that the second part of the verse (read it) is true in my life. Jesus’ light has shined upon me and I understood the meaning of verse 3 (read first part). There’s a huge joy for those that come out from the path of darkness and let Jesus’ light shine upon them. Such a joy is so immense that the prophet compares it to the joy in harvest – a good harvest is joyful to everyone – imagine those ancient times when people had to deal with their small crops all throughout the year. Imagine how joyful people were when there was a very good harvest.

But the prophet continues. He says about the joy of dividing the spoil after the war. I have never been on a war, but it must be a fantastic feeling of relief when the war is over. You may finally look around, check the extent of your wounds and then look forward on returning home, to your family, to your lovely wife and, on the way, you will divide whatever the enemy has left behind – relics that will bring to memory those awful moments of war.

With that war scene in mind, the prophet sends us back to Christ; saying on verse 4 (read it). He remembers us that Christ is the one to free us. He frees us from the dominion of sin and that is the reason why we should rejoice like we have seen in verse 3. Christ restores us from the slavery of sin.

But at the end of verse 4, the prophet mentions “as the day of Midian”. He is referring to when Gideon got an entire victory over the Midianites with a few unarmed men, by the sound of trumpets, and breaking of pitchers. It was a military victory without any violence at all. And this is completed in verse 5 (read it). Every battle is full of noise and blood but let’s pay attention here: the prophet says about a burning fire. Christ’s victory over sin was as soon over as any combustible is burnt with fire.

(Read verse 5) A child was born: human flesh but truly God in spirit. A son who brought light to the darkness of sin! A son who brought joy as that of the good harvest! A son who won the battle against sin and the dominion of evil in our hearts without any violence!

Christmas is when we remember the birth of Jesus Christ. But it is definitely more important for us to renew our vows with him. We may have had a history of sins in the past. We may have sinned yesterday or even today. We may have been under the power of sin and darkness and that is why I want you to remember that Christ is the one to bring light upon your darkness, joy unto your life and victory over sin.

Use this Christmas to have Jesus birth in your life. Let the son, the Wonderful Counselor, the Prince of Peace to bring peace onto your life. If you decide to do that, from the bottom of your heart, God himself will lead you. Forget all those nice traditions of Christmas and start a new life with Jesus today.
