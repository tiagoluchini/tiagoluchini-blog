It came as a huge surprise to me that Sun's <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=238" target="_blank">JSR 238</a> also known as MIA and responsible for Internationalization on MIDP 2.0 compatible devices happens to be an OPTIONAL package. It means that implementors decide if they want to implement it or not.

It turns out that some devices are just plain incompatible with this package and programmers have to reimplement their solutions by hand.

Not a very smart move! Mainly for something so simple. It is like launching a car but horn is optional. Way to go Sun!
