As long as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482571/" target="_blank">The Prestige</a> is concerned, the trend is the opposite. Do not be fooled by the simple bluish cover: it is a superb movie!

I really appreciate stories that take place in the 18th or 19th centuries and that deal with science, mystery and magic. The Prestige is full of these providing a very good entertainment option for H. G. Wells fans.

Its plot is a complex and entangled web of events in the life of two young and competing magicians in London. The story-line is very tightly weaved and is presented as flashbacks as well as current events that keep you anxiously expecting for the next move.

A surprising conclusion makes it even more entertaining. A couple of thumbs up!
