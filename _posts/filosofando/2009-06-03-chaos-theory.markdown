> "Ever heard of Chaos theory? It's a Science. It tries to determine underlying patterns in chaotic systems.. weather, ocean currents, blood flow... that sort of things. But it turns out that there are few things more chaotic than the beat of the human heart. It's beating up, slowing down. Pretty face, flirty stares. It's always changing depending on what's happening to ourselves out there. It's an erratic son of a bitch. But underneath all of that bumpity bump mess, there is in fact a pattern: the truth... and it's love.

> The most important thing about love is that we choose to give it, and we choose to receive it; making it the least random act in the entire Universe. It transcends blood, it transcends betrayal and all of the dirt that makes us human." (Daniel Taplitz through the character Frank Allen of Chaos Theory/2007)
