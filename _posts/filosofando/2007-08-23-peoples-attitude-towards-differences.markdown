It is unbelievable how people deal poorly with other people's differences.

I have been (re)learning C recently and its intrinsic very annoying, cumbersome and error-prone manual clean up and memory allocation processes.

Checking an entry in the reference docs about a function that could segfault if no previously allocated memory space was provided I faced the authors' outrageous affirmation:

> "... if destination is not large enough  (that  is, if  the programmer was stupid/lazy, and failed to check the size before copying) then anything might happen."

It is a well known fact that C is cumbersome and error-prone when it comes to allocating and deallocating memory. The act of considering someone that _does not like/care_ about these _sanitary_ details as _stupid/lazy_ is a dangerous amount of presumption and naivety coped together.

These afore mentioned authors would have a nervous breakdown if forced to work with Python or Ruby. As for this humble "lazy/stupid" author who signs this blog, I have more important concerns.
