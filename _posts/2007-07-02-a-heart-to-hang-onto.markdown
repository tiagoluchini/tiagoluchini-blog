<strong>A Heart  to Hang Onto
(Pete Townshend</strong> )

<em>  		Johnny boy, he's always propping up the bar
He's sees life crystallized through his jar
He says he only lives for beer
But deep in his heart is a cry of fear</em>

<em>Give me a heart to hang onto
Give me a soul that's tailored new
Give me a heart to hang onto
A heart to hang onto</em>

<em>Sally seems to get bigger everyday
She evens out in a contented way
A finger on the pulse of every guy
But deep in the night you can hear her cry</em>

<em>Give me a heart to hang onto
Give me a life that's tailored new
Give me a heart to hang onto
<class id="NoSteal"></class>
Oh please a heart to hang onto</em>

<em>Give me heart to hang onto
Give me a soul that's tailored new
Give me a heart to hang onto</em>

<em>Danny, he wants to save for a new guitar
He's going to learn to play but he won't get far
He thinks it's an easy going' high
But his whole life is just another try</em>

<em>Give me a heart to hang onto
Give me a suit that's tailored true
Give me a heart to hang onto
A heart to hang onto</em>

<em>I need a heart... to hang onto...</em>
