**Here I Go Again** _(Whitesnake)_

I don't know where I'm going
But, I sure know where I've been
Hanging on the promises
And the songs of yesterday
And I've made up my mind,
I ain't wasting no more time
But, here I go again
Here I go again

Though I keep searching for an answer,
I never seem to find what I'm looking for
In the Lord I pray
To give me strength to carry on,
cos I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams.

And here I go again on my own
Going down the only road I've ever known,
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone
And I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time

I'm just another heart in need of rescue,
Waiting on loves' sweet charity
And I'm gonna hold on
For the rest of my days,
cos I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams.

An here I go again on my own
Going down the only road Ive ever known,
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone
And I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time.

But, here I go again,
Here I go again... x 4

And I've made up my mind,
I ain't wasting no more time

And here I go again on my own
Going down the only road I've ever known,
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone
and I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams

So here I go again on my own
Going down the only road Ive ever known,
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone
And I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time...

Here I go again...

Here I go again...
