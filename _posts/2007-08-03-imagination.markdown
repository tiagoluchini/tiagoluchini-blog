<span lang="EN-GB">In a world full of sensorial inputs we are rapidly loosing our imagination and delegating creations 100% to movie makers and market gurus.<o:p></o:p></span>

<span lang="EN-GB">I remember when I read my first horror book a long time ago. I had never felt so scared in my whole life. I can still remember a couple of very terrifying scenes. It is very interesting that to be still capale of remembering these scenes in great detail. I remember the colours and materials, the textures and even the smell of certain things!<o:p></o:p></span>

<span lang="EN-GB">Obviously, these things never existed for real. They were just a mental representation created by the written inputs from the book I was reading. It is really impressive that those lines of text were imprinted much deeper in me than those of an expensive movies full of computer generated graphics. Back then, I learned to appreciate written fiction and carried that behaviour for life.<o:p></o:p></span>

<span lang="EN-GB">But the sensorial inputs of our post-modern life are astounding and we get lazy. We forget that there is something called “imagination”.<o:p></o:p></span>

<span lang="EN-GB">I recently came to remember this by being introduced to a computer game called <a href="http://www.nethack.org/" target="_blank">NetHack</a>. I am not a computer games person but I have seen some of the most recent games and all look fantastically dressed in immersive 3D graphics that are as close to reality as your hardware allows. <o:p></o:p></span>

<a href="http://www.tiagoluchini.eu/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/icon_quake_big.jpg" target="_blank" title="icon_quake_big.jpg"><img src="http://www.tiagoluchini.eu/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/icon_quake_big.thumbnail.jpg" title="Quake 4" alt="Quake 4" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5" /></a><span lang="EN-GB">In any one of these brand new games, if you see a monster, you know exactly how it looks like. The game creators took care of that for you. They created a 10 feet tall green entity with dog-like face, drooling a brown, smudgy and stinky material from its distorted mouth-like cavity. You get what you see - what has been provided for you.<o:p></o:p></span>

<span lang="EN-GB">NetHack goes completely against the tide. It does not have graphics – at all! It uses a very rudimentary navigation system with characters spread all over a black screen. The same monster depicted above is probably represented by a single character like ‘F’ followed by a textual description of it. <o:p></o:p></span>

<a href="http://www.tiagoluchini.eu/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/gnomishbig.gif" target="_blank" title="gnomishbig.gif"><img src="http://www.tiagoluchini.eu/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/gnomishbig.thumbnail.gif" title="NetHack" alt="NetHack" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5" /></a><span lang="EN-GB">The purpose of the makers of NetHack is not to stuff you with lots of graphical input but to focus on game-play and story-line. The idea is to grab your attention by imagination and not by vision.<o:p></o:p></span>

<span lang="EN-GB">This might be the main reason why NetHack has been under constant development for more than 15 years. Even with a gigant proliferation of sensorial inputs all around us, some people still play NetHack. Finishing it is quite a challenge and those that have done so, sometimes play it all over again because the story-line never follows the same pattern.<o:p></o:p></span>

<span lang="EN-GB">It is good to know that some people are not trapped by the reality created by others but are capable of creating their own realities – with their own imagination!<o:p></o:p></span>

<span lang="EN-GB">Where this humble writer is concerned, I must desperately find a way to free myself from a bear trap that is holding me  by my right foot before the treacherous gnomes and their powerful leader approach. If I manage to survive this quest, I will probably hunt them down to find out what is that violet gem they have being protecting so fiercely. It would be a shame to die after having survived a massive attack of giant bugs and an elf werewolf and its accompanying jackals. As you might have noticed, I got carried way… by the way, my skin really hurts by the burnt of a liquid acid thrown at me when I was not looking.</span>

Have a nice imaginative time!
