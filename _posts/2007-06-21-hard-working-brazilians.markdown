I have known this for quite a long time having had lots of cultural clashes throughout my professional career. But there is one recurrent subject when talking to people from many different countries: how hard-working each country's people are?<o:p></o:p></span>

<span lang="EN-GB">Right underneath this question lays a cultural aspect much more complex than it appears at glance. First, the concept of "hard-working" has a huge weight of cultural meaning. I am sure that, if simply questioned about the meaning of "hard-working", people from different cultures will respond with a gigantic array of meanings.<o:p></o:p></span>

<span lang="EN-GB">Hypothetically speaking, an American for instance, might understand "hard-work" as "working towards making our Great Nation strengthen and expand our economical, political and military reach over the world". At the opposite corner, a fundamentalist from a Muslim movement might understand "hard-work" as "working hard for making our beliefs shown to the World even if I have to become a martyr".<o:p></o:p></span>

<span lang="EN-GB">I am not questioning the two opposite views here or whether one is right over the other. My point is that "hard-work" does not mean the same thing in every cultural environment.<o:p></o:p></span>

<span lang="EN-GB">That said; let's move to the second point: if the "hard-working" concept <em>per se</em> is not easily shared among people, is it worth comparing working behaviours among different cultures? I think not.<o:p></o:p></span>

<span lang="EN-GB">I have come across lots of misunderstandings regarding this subject now that I am working mainly in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Finland</st1:country-region></st1:place>. It is common for Finns to read our Brazilian behaviour towards work as a relaxed and unreliable one. It is understood that we have no worries, no stress and that we rarely get a job properly done - mainly when it comes to having it done within a certain level of quality at a certain time and under a certain cost.<o:p></o:p></span>

<span lang="EN-GB">This view surprised me at first. It really did. I had this mind-image of hard-working immigrants that went to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Brazil</st1:place></st1:country-region> from all over the world in search for a better life, striving to build a new home-country from absolute nothing. Or that view of slaves that were forcibly taken from <st1:place w:st="on">Africa</st1:place> and who creatively invented even a [now-famous] fighting system to rebel against their oppressors.<o:p></o:p></span>

<span lang="EN-GB">I remembered all those simple people that I met. People with very little education but with a huge cultural baggage of love, friendship and openness that worked too hard, even harder than they should (or even humanly could) - mainly after travelling more than 2 hours just to get to their jobs usually departing from very ugly and badly preserved parts of the town where they actually live and raise their kids.<o:p></o:p></span>

<span lang="EN-GB">There were also those hundreds of executives and office-workers in general, either working from 08AM to 10PM or having two shifts by working 9 or even 10 hours every day and then attending night school to get some academic background. They are culturally forced to dress with a complete business-suit on those very hot days frequently having their possessions pick-pocketed or just been flash-kidnapped. All this just so that they are able to run and expand the biggest and most profitable multinationals located in foreign land on Earth.<o:p></o:p></span>

<span lang="EN-GB">Culturally speaking, I call this hard-work. <o:p></o:p></span>

<span lang="EN-GB">But this is not how we, Brazilians, sell the idea to other cultures. We continuously sell carnival, sensuality and unreliability as our main “brands”. Comparing culturally-heavy concepts is ineffective but marketing positive aspects would be a nice way of building a better self-image abroad.<o:p></o:p></span>
