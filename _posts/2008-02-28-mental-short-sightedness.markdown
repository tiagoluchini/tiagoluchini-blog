It must have been really difficult for short-sighted people in the stone age. Imagine yourself trying to hunt a giant mammoth without even being able to find the bloody animal. You can also be completely unaware of the fact you are carrying your spear the blunt-side first. I am sure these things were quite embarrassing for stone-age standards.

My level of myopia is so high that stone age people would just abandon me or decide to turn my delicious body into some barbecue party.

It is pretty clear that having used glasses since I was 8 actually saved my life. Lots of times. This obviously affected my almost non-existent sports-life but greatly increased my chances of not becoming a meal for bigger animals for example.

Although glasses spared those that would eventually die in nature, our society still has not worked on a solution for a different kind of short-sightedness: the mental short-sightedness.

Take software projects for instance. One of the most important characteristic that you should find in someone working in these projects is “vision”. The problem is that it is also the very same characteristic these professionals lack the most.

Vision is a pretty simple concept. From the purely physical perspective, when you approach a blind person it is pretty obvious the person has no vision at all. Vision is a tool that you use to view things that are immediately in front of you. If you have a good vision, you’ll be able to view things that are very distant from you. If are short-sighted like me, you’ll certainly be able do see as far as the length of your nose.

This is exactly the kind of vision IT professionals lack. They would all be eaten by bigger animals or be abandoned by their workmates in nature. On the other hand, they should be able to look right ahead and see things that will approach them in the near future. If you are devising a software project, as a professional with enough vision, you should be able to make decisions now that will make yours and other’s lives easier in the future.

Do not let your mental short-sightedness affect your professional vision. Buy some hypothetical glasses that allow you to see far onto the future. I assure you life will be much simpler.
