At a very early stage in our lives we all realize that there is a big gap between speech and practice. Our parents and educators are our first source of frustration on that front. As we grow, we just assume this is the way life is.

I confess that most of cynical way of seeing life and people is rooted on this gap (sometimes pretty huge). University time was definitely the worst. The problem was that I was studying at night - my major was Business Administration. We approached the subject as nice American books say it should be but, at the same time, was feverish trying to cope with a day-time professional life that looked plainly distant from those books.

A very interesting concept that made me laugh uncontrollably was "empowering". In general terms, "empowering" is to move power (in terms of management, decisions, political-wise, etc) onto lower levels in corporative structures. You empower your employees by allowing them to exercise greater levels in decision-taking processes for example. As far as my life experience was concerned at the time, there couldn't be anything further from reality.

But there seems to be hope somewhere. Last weekend I attended to a talent show organized by my son's school. Well, I should rephrase that: a talent show whose organization was delegated to the older students from my son's school. It explains the scenario better. The school deliberately decided to empower its students (early teens) by allowing them to manage a full-morning event. Interesting enough, "empowering" is one of the school values hanging on the walls.

Similar events I had participated before looked like a huge effort from the school to over-control its organization (to the extent of turning it in a tasteless, pasteurized spectacle). It makes some sense: you are putting all your paying parents in the same room to experience a "taste" of "school life" for a couple of hours. You don't want them to be frustrated. It is pretty tempting to sell your fish the best you can instead of letting unexperienced and irresponsible teenagers take care of the show. But, on the other hand, if centralized control is the way to go, why should you teach otherwise?

When you teach a value that does not belong to your immediate reality, this value will certainly disappear from the learner's mind or simply not be assimilated at all.
