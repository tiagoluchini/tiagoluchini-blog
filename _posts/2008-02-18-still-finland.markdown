From Filand's biggest newspaper, <a href="http://www.hs.fi/english/extras/toolong" target="_blank">Helsingin Sanomat</a>:
<blockquote>"In many ways, Finland is an island.  This is best seen in the fact that numerous rock  bands and other artists think twice before playing Helsinki, as they will  have to cart 25 truckloads of equipment by sea from Sweden and back, thus adding  two or three days to their schedule for just the one gig."

"Finns are quite future-oriented  at two particular times of the year.  On the day after Midsummer,  they say "Well, it's all downhill from now on" and prepare feverishly for winter, and  similarly after December 21st they perk up and start thinking about Midsummer -  ignoring the fact that they still have to get through January, February and  March before the place becomes inhabitable again..."</blockquote>
Even though...
<blockquote>"[...]You can't understand why people live anywhere but in Finland."</blockquote>
