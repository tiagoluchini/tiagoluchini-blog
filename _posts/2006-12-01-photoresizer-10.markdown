I have baptized it "PhotoResizer". As the name implies, this is a small tool to resize your digital photos and normally reduced the amount of space needed to store it on your computer.

There are tons of resizers on the market. I have tested some of them and I must confess that there are some really good stuff out there. Even though, there were two points where I always thought these tools should target differently: simplicity and control. Most options I tested had complex multi-phased screens and would normally generate a very poor-quality result.

The aim behind this little project of mine is to create a simple interface that gives you a lot of control over the result but with no complication.

Some of the features available in version 1.0:
<p style="font-weight: bold">Right Click activation</p>
The PhotoResizer tool can be lauched as a normal Windows application on the Programs folder of the Start menu. Another very convenient way of starting it is by choosing a picture file on your Explorer window, right-clicking on it and then choosing PhotoResizer. Lauching the program this way will make it load the specific file automatically. This is an ideal solution if you intend to resize just one photo.
<p style="font-weight: bold">Single file or Batch mode</p>
You can either make PhotoResizer to act upon one single image file or you can set it to batch mode where it will resize using the same set up, all the files on a supplied folder. This is a very good option when you have a series of similar photos and wants to  apply the same resizing configuration to all of them.
<p style="font-weight: bold">Estimate target size</p>
Sometimes all you want to do is make that huge 6.1MP photo which is taking 4MB of your hard-disk space to fit on 50KB so that you can upload it onto your blog. With PhotoResizer you are able to play with the configurations and then ask it to estimate how big the target file will be.
<p style="font-weight: bold">Size and Control Bars</p>
This is where the simplicity of PhotoResizer is actually proven. To resize your image, you will be dealing with two slide bars that will put you in control of two complimentary variables: the actual size (width x height) and the quality (resolution) of the target photo.

The smaller these two variables are set, smaller the target file will be. The price you pay is that the quality and the dimensions of the photo will be reduced. The opposite is true as well: the bigger the variables are, bigger the final outcome.

PhotoResizer automatically sets both, size and quality to 50%. That means your photo will be 50% smaller in terms of dimensions and will loose 50% of its quality. You can set these two slide bars to wherever you feel comfortable.
<p style="font-weight: bold">Moving and Renaming of Destination</p>
Some resizing tools have the really bad habit of overwriting your original photo. To avoid that, PhotoResizer automatically creates a "smaller" version of the photo (or photos) as soon as you order it to proceed with your resizing. In order to differentiate the original version from the reduced version, it adds the suffix "-small" to the name of the file.

Following the basic principle behind PhotoResizer, you still have the option to control this behavior. You are allowed to use a different suffix and to choose a different target folder where reduced pictures will be saved.
<p style="font-weight: bold">To-do List</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Multilanguage </strong>- people in China should be able to use PhotoResizer in their own language</li>
	<li><strong>Preset mode</strong> - it would be interesting to fix a target dimension and have the software calculate the other variables to you</li>
	<li><strong>Fix target size </strong> - same as above but with a "target" size in bytes</li>
	<li><strong>Save last-used configuration</strong> - currently, PhotoResizer will reset everytime you restart it</li>
</ul>
