    About
  </h2>

  <p><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Who and Where?</span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"> I am Brazilian, born in <st1:city w:st="on">SÃ£o Paulo</st1:city> and currently living in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Finland</st1:place></st1:country-region> (very close to the freezing and dark North Pole on a cosy town called Oulu) - married to a lovely wife and father of a boy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <p><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Work?</span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"> More than 12 years of professional experience and still unsure what exactly is this thing that I do. I tend to assume two distinct faces: either the <em>outstanding programmer</em> that knows a <em>lot of business</em> or the <em>outstanding business person</em> that knows a <em>lot of programming</em>. All those multitudes of intermediate labels also apply (project manager, system architect, product leader and so forth). I normally understand but am not very keen on buzz words of both worlds (technology- and business-wise).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <p><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Writing?</span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"> I appreciate writing very much - both in English (my second language) and Portuguese-Brazilian (native). This blog works as a channel to dump practically everything that comes to my mind. Eventually this keeps me sane. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <p><strong><span lang="EN-GB">What else? </span></strong><span lang="EN-GB">I carry a small bag of simple beliefs with me. Most of them are based on Christian faith but some are based on practical experience, science and philosophy as well. Along the way, this bag of beliefs becomes full or I just throw things away. It is a quite an unstable bag. The only thing I really try to keep central is the faith in God and His graceful mercy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
