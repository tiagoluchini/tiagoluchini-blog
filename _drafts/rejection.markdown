One of the worst feelings one can bear is rejection. Humans are not 
tailored for rejection. Since birth, our minds are prepared to be 
accepted. The idea is to come to this world in a loving family, to be 
received by other older and wiser beings that will accept the newborn 
and nurture him in all ways needed.

This initial pre-assumed acceptance can be obviously missing 
hence the billions of tramatized individuals one can find in every 
corner. Humans are designed to be accepted and not rejected. Rejection 
normally comes a bit later: the feeling of being rejected by the parents 
who stubburnly refuse to let one go out and play in that rainy day 
simply because there is a remote possibility of getting a recurring 
cold; or the feeling of being put out of a certain group in school due 
to stupid untold requirements or simply by being rejected by one's first 
love.

Interesting and unhuman enough, our society is hardly structured around 
rejection. Whole classes are rejected from certain places; love lives 
are destroyed by mutual rejections; jobs are given and taken by 
rejecting each other's feelings. 

Even if completely unnatural, rejection is everywhere. Humans come to a 
world through a miracle of acceptance. Against all odds, humans are 
brought to life with an immortal soul which is unique and pre-accepted 
by God but this is soon messed up by our polluted interests.
