Flying has always been a bit of a logical paradox to me. It's a common 
saying in my home country that flights should never be trusted. The 
reasoning is that it's a stupidity to fly on a device heavier than 
your house, fueled by a combustion engine and invented by a Brazilian 
(yes, in Brazil the airplane was invented by a Brazilian - I've heard 
recently that Indians claim the same - it might be that no one really
invented the airplane and it was simply given to us by higher 
inteligences: the dolphins).

The lack of logic starts as soon as you board the plane. One of the 
first things the flight attendant says at the passenger announcement 
system is: "Turn off all electronic devices now and keep them 
turned off throughout the duration of the flight." The funny thing is 
that when preparing for landing the same flight attendant kindly asks 
passengers to "turn off all electronic devices before landing". If they 
were suposed to be turned off 
before taking off and were not supposed to be turned on during the 
flight, how come they must still be turned off before landing?

Then you decide to visit the toilet just to find another ilogical 
situation there. There is a bunch of disposible cups to be 
fetched from the dashboard. Right under it there's the following sign 
though:


![Don't drink](/images/dont_drink.gif)

If you can't drink the water, why would you get a cup from the 
dashboard. I don't expect people to pee on them, do you?. That's 
certainly not drinkable "water" at least.

Airplane toilets are full of paradoxes. There's a litter with a "No 
cigarretes" sign on it. The funny thing is that you are not supposed to 
smoke on planes - at all. Why would they mention "No cigarretes" then? 
Does it mean I can't throw a cigarrete I have never fired up? Why? 

These signs can be understood in old planes that were still used when smoking 
was allowed. As soon as new planes are built or old ones are 
refurbished, these signs are one of the first things one would 
assume to be removed. Apparently someone is still selling brand new "No 
cigarretes" stickers for planes.s.

One of the magic paradoxes about flying is when you get to your 
destination. It turns out that it takes many minutes for you to get from 
the plane to the baggage claim area. Sometimes you have to walk a lot 
and even take one or two trains just to find that you still need to 
take a bus to another terminal. In some airports, you 
have the impression that the baggage claim is in a different city. The 
interesting thing is that, the further the baggage claim area is, the 
more probable your bag is already on the belt when you get there. But 
how do they get your bag there before YOU get there? Why don't they use 
the same tranportation system they use on the bags on us?
